# Obstacle-Avoidable-AGV

Obstacle avoidance planning algorithm based on "Artificial Potential Field Theory" and increment PID control code for Mecanum-wheel-based AGV

The aim is to design and control a obstacle avoidable automated guided vehicle that can transport some goods. All the parts and structure is designed by ourselves (a three-people team including me as a leader). We are so pround that our little "bady" can finish the obstacle avoidance work beautifully and efficently.

## Electrical Schematic diagram

We use the STM32 as the main MCU of the system, equipped bluetooth module and WIFI module for communication. Besides, we have four ultrasound sensors and one IMU to help the robot finish the obstable avoid task.
