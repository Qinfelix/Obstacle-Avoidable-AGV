# Obstacle-Avoidable-AGV

Obstacle avoidance planning algorithm based on "Artificial Potential Field Theory" and increment PID control code for Mecanum-wheel-based AGV

The aim is to design and control a obstacle avoidable automated guided vehicle that can transport some goods. All the parts and structure is designed by ourselves (a three-people team including me as a leader). We are so pround that our little "bady" can finish the obstacle avoidance work beautifully and efficently.
